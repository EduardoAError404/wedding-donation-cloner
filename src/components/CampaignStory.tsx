          Dear Friends and Family,
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We are thrilled to announce our upcoming wedding and would love to share this special moment with all of you! 
          As we begin this new chapter of our lives together, we are incredibly grateful for the love and support 
          you have shown us throughout our journey.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Planning a wedding is both exciting and challenging, especially when trying to create the perfect day 
          that reflects our love story. We want to celebrate with all our loved ones in a meaningful way, 
          and your contributions would help us make our dream wedding a reality.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The funds will go towards:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
          <li>Venue and reception</li>
          <li>Catering for our guests</li>
          <li>Photography and videography</li>
          <li>Flowers and decorations</li>
          <li>Music and entertainment</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Every contribution, no matter the size, means the world to us. Your presence at our wedding 
          is the greatest gift, but if you would like to help us financially, we would be incredibly thankful.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          With all our love and gratitude,<br />
